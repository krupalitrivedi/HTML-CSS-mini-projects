# HTML and CSS - Mini Projects

HTML and CSS are the base tech for web development or maybe that's what I think. Neverthless,
I will be updating this repository with my mini projects which can be written fast and to be honest
are very fun to make. 




## What Will The Repo Have:

- HTML and CSS from University lessons
- FreeCodeCamp Projects (As I am learning from the platform.)
- Projects inspired by other developers 
- Project Ideas that I get (if I get any, that is!)
- I surf a lot through Pinterest finding project ideas so that!
